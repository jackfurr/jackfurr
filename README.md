### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fun project at Life360 to connect family members

- ⚡ Fun fact: 
  * I was once asked by a co-founder's father in law to help him with his burial plans. (awkward 😬)
  * Helped give CPR to the co-founder's dog in the back seat of a car.  Sad story 😢

- ⭐️ Technologies:
  * JavaScript, NodeJS, TypeScript, React, PHP
  * MySQL, DynamoDB, SQS, RabbitMQ, Redis, Memcached
  * Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GCP
