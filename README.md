### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project at Life360 to connect family members

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of Kubernetes

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
  * I was once asked by a co-founder's father in law to help him with his burial plans. (awkward ğŸ˜¬)
  * Helped give CPR to the co-founder's dog in the back seat of a car.  Sad story ğŸ˜¢
